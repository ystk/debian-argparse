debian/rules has a get-orig-source target.

This makefile target will be able to fetch the upstream zip tarball and
create a tar.gz archive out of it.

Infact, this package was created with the source archive generated by the
get-orig-source target.


This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.
See /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source for a detailed explanation.
